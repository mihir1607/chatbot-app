# Chatbot Application

This chatbot application is intended to support customers by placing orders for them as well as to answer questions posted by the user in natural language. The chatbot can answer the questions based on natural language as well as place orders using a pre-defined syntax.

## Technologies Used

* Angular: For building the frontend of the application

* Node.js: For building the backend of the application

* MongoDB: Database for storing application data

* Python: For writing the classifier to answer questions placed in natural language

## Setup Instructions

Clone the repo to your system and use npm install in the chatbot-frontend folder to install the node_modules folder

### Training the model

1. After cloning the repo, head to chatbot-backend -> src -> classifier.
2. In the same folder, a file (clf.pkl) has been saved which contains the trained model on faq_new.txt file.
3. If the file should be deleted to train on a new model, then comment lines 31 and 98 and uncomment lines 32 and 99 in script (python file).
4. Run the program once, this will train the model and create file clf.pkl.
5. Undo the changes made in step 3, the program will then be able to run with the node application.
